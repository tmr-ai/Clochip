## Run App on your device:

1. Run a single to install the App:

    `npm install`

2. Run a single command to build for android:

    `npm run android`



Note: You need Android Studio for it to work. After Android Studio was opened, the gradle should build automatically. Then you need to select your target device and run the App on it.
